# Playback Time Savings Calculator
A project to familiarize myself with Vue.js. 

I often watch videos online at an increased rate of playback, depending on the subject matter, using this helpful [browser extension]([https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk)). This project takes a duration in hours, minutes and seconds, and a playback rate and returns the amount of time you would save if you watched something of that duration at that rate.
